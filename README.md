# leaflet-challenge

Welcome to the United States Geological Survey, or USGS for short! The USGS is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment; and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes. As a new hire, you will be helping them out with an exciting new project!

The USGS is interested in building a new set of tools that will allow them visualize their earthquake data. They collect a massive amount of data from all over the world each day, but they lack a meaningful way of displaying it. Their hope is that being able to visualize their data will allow them to better educate the public and other government organizations (and hopefully secure more funding..) on issues facing our planet.

For this project i created a map using leaflet, which ploted all of the earthquakes from the past 7 days  on a map based on their longitude,latitude and depth. The darker a circle the deaper the earthquake. If a circle is clicked it will show additional information about the earthquake occurence. There is also a legen on the right hand side to help provide context to the gravity of the earthquake.
